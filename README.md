## Data Modeling
### SARIMA Model
This project applies a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model to publicly available CDC Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) surveillance data to analyze temporal dynamics and forecast future respiratory infection trends. The workflow includes data preparation, exploratory visualization, model fitting, diagnostics, and 12-month forecasting to capture seasonal patterns and temporal autocorrelation.
